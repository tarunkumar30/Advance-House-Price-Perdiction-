# House Price Prediction Project

## Description
This project demonstrates house price prediction using linear regression. It includes data analysis and model building using Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Structure
- `Analysis_Data.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing
- `Model_building.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for building and evaluating the linear regression model
- `train_data.csv`: Training dataset
- `test_data.csv`: Test dataset
- `Data set/`: Directory containing additional data files (train.csv, test.csv)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run `Analysis_Data.ipynb` first to analyze and preprocess the data
3. Run `Model_building.ipynb` to build and evaluate the linear regression model

## Model
The project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on various features in the dataset.
